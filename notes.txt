DeFi Stablecoin notes:

This project is similar to protocols like MakerDao with DAI. Users deposit a token, such as ETH, and in return receive DSC, a stablecoin pegged to the USD. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Why would someone do this?

Lets say you have ETH but you do not want to sell it.
You want liquidity, for other purposes, without selling.
Or you want to take a leveraged posiiton (essentially invest more than you currently own by borrowing).

In this case, the user can deposit ETH, receive DSC, and use that DSC to purhcase more ETH, BTC or other assets - a leveraged position (increasing exposure without actually investing more of your own capital, which you may not possess).

Advanced traders may also follow a strategy or depositing ETH, receiving DSC, purchase more ETH, deposit, receive more DSC - in a looping pattern. 
Albeit, this increases exposure increases risk of liquidation if ETH price falls and the user becomes undercollaterised.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Who are liquidators and why would they liquidate positions?

Liquidators are typically bots. They monitor users positions, scanning for undercollaterisation to liquidate. 
In return, liquidators receive bonuses. Why? To incentivise. They are essentially the security guards keeping our protocol secure and properly backed.

A liquidator may follow these steps:
- look for users who have deposited collateral and received stablecoin
- check health factors (must be 1 or above) and collateralisation (must be 200% or above)
- after identifying a user which is ellible for liquidation, they burn their own DSC, and take the undercollaterised position to bring the users health factor either partially, or fully, to healthy level.
- In return, they receive both the collateralisation, such as ETH, and an additional 10% bonus. 
- for example, lets say a user deposited ETH valued at $2000 and minted $1000 DSC - starting at 200% collateralisation.
- if the price of ETH dropped to, say, $1500, the user now has an undercollaterised position (150%) and their health factor is below 1 - making them elligble for liquidation.
- the liquidator can repay the debt of $500, and receive the $500 of ETH at its current price, plus a 10% bonus, totalling $550 ETH.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Why burn?

When a user deposits collateral and mint DSC, they increase the token supply. However, when the collateral backing this token supply is reduced, we need a mechanism to reduce the stablecoin supply back to a healthy level.
A liquidator will have pre-existing DSC, and will burn it when they cover the users undercollaterised position, bringing the DSC supply back to healthy levels.
