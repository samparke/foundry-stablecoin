# Decentralised Stablecoin
This project involves:
1. Depositing collateral, such as Wrapped ETH (weth) and Wrapped BTC (wbtc).
2. Receiving a decentralised stablecoin in return.

This emulates protocols like MakerDao (now Sky Money), where users deposit collateral and receive a decentralised, overcollateralised (150%), stablecoin.
